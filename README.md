## Error
 - The "Siguiente" button, once you have checked an exam, lets you pass the exam limit (100 questions) and directly starts showing next year's exam (2024 -&gt; 2022) and so on
 - Answers are not marked in the resume, so we have to go through each question to check if it is the one we got wrong or right.
